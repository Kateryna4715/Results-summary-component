# Results-summary-component

I've decided to continue getting better in web development and here comes the second challenge for Frontend Mentor.

While working on the component, I had a perfect opportunity to use media queries for the first time and to practice flexbox. It might be too many flexboxes here ðŸ˜…, but they are too handy to cutting on using them.

Also I figured out that transition for background-image of the button does not work as I expected (it does not work at all actualy), so I started looking for the answer on the internet and now, after successful research, I think the result of hover affect is more appealing than a usual background-color transition.

To be honest, the project was quite tricky for me. Though the design seems right and it means that challenge is complete but I didn`t manage to carry out a bonus task and I am a little sad ðŸ˜’ But I am not going to give up and perhaps next challenge would be with js ðŸ˜‡
